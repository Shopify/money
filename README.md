money_column expects a decimal 8,3 database field.

### Features

- Keeps value in decimal
- Provides a `Money` class which encapsulates all information about an certain
  amount of money, such as its value and its currency.
- Provides a `Money::Currency` class which encapsulates all information about
  a monetary unit.
- Does NOT provides APIs for exchanging money from one currency to another.
- wont lose pennies during division!
- Money::NullCurrency for no currency support

## Installation

    gem 'money', github: 'shopify/money'

## Usage

``` ruby
require 'money'

# 10.00 USD
money = Money.new(10.00, "USD")
money.subunits     #=> 1000
money.currency  #=> Currency.new("USD")

# Comparisons
Money.new(1000, "USD") == Money.new(1000, "USD")   #=> true
Money.new(1000, "USD") == Money.new(100, "USD")    #=> false
Money.new(1000, "USD") == Money.new(1000, "EUR")   #=> false
Money.new(1000, "USD") != Money.new(1000, "EUR")   #=> true

# Arithmetic
Money.new(1000, "USD") + Money.new(500, "USD") == Money.new(1500, "USD")
Money.new(1000, "USD") - Money.new(200, "USD") == Money.new(800, "USD")
Money.new(1000, "USD") / 5                     == Money.new(200, "USD")
Money.new(1000, "USD") * 5                     == Money.new(5000, "USD")

# Unit to subunit conversions
Money.from_subunits(500, "USD") == Money.new(5, "USD")  # 5 USD
Money.from_subunits(5, "JPY") == Money.new(5, "JPY")    # 5 JPY
Money.from_subunits(5000, "TND") == Money.new(5, "TND") # 5 TND
```

## Currency

Currencies are consistently represented as instances of `Money::Currency`.
The most part of `Money` APIs allows you to supply either a `String` or a
`Money::Currency`.

``` ruby
Money.new(1000, "USD") == Money.new(1000, Money::Currency.new("USD"))
Money.new(1000, "EUR").currency == Money::Currency.new("EUR")
```

A `Money::Currency` instance holds all the information about the currency,
including the currency symbol, name and much more.

``` ruby
currency = Money.new(1000, "USD").currency
currency.iso_code #=> "USD"
currency.name     #=> "United States Dollar"
currency.to_s     #=> 'USD'
currency.symbol   #=> '$'
currency.disambiguate_symbol #=> 'US$'
```

### Default Currency

By default `Money` defaults to Money::NullCurrency as its currency. This can be overwritten
using:

``` ruby
Money.default_currency = Money::Currency.new("USD")
```

If you use Rails, then `environment.rb` is a very good place to put this.

### Currency Minor Units

The exponent of a money value is the number of digits after the decimal
separator (which separates the major unit from the minor unit).

``` ruby
Money::Currency.new("USD").minor_units  # => 2
Money::Currency.new("JPY").minor_units  # => 0
Money::Currency.new("MGA").minor_units  # => 1
```


## Contributing to money

- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
- Fork the project
- Start a feature/bugfix branch
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
